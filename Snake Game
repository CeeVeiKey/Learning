Description
This is a classic Snake Game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.

Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have a basic understanding of a programming language like Python and have a compatible development environment set up.

Installation
1. Clone the repository :
git clone <repository_url>

Change to the game directory:
cd snake-game


Usage
Run the game script to start playing the Snake Game:
python snake_game.py

Code Explanation
The code is divided into several parts to handle different aspects of the game.

1. Setting Up the Game Window
The game window is created using a graphics library (e.g., Pygame). It initializes the game window, sets the window size, and handles event handling for keyboard inputs.
# Initialize the game window
pygame.init()
width, height = 640, 480
window = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

# Event handling for keyboard inputs
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
            # Handle left key press
        elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
            # Handle right key press
        elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
            # Handle up key press
        elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
            # Handle down key press
2. Snake Movement and Collision Detection
This part of the code handles the movement of the snake, updating its position based on the player's input. It also checks for collision with the food and the boundaries of the game window.
# Move the snake based on player's input
if direction == "LEFT":
    x -= block_size
elif direction == "RIGHT":
    x += block_size
elif direction == "UP":
    y -= block_size
elif direction == "DOWN":
    y += block_size

# Check collision with food
if x == food_x and y == food_y:
    # Increase snake length and generate new food

# Check collision with boundaries
if x >= width or x < 0 or y >= height or y < 0:
    # End the game
3. Displaying the Snake and Food
This part handles the visualization of the snake and the food on the game window. It uses graphics functions to draw rectangles for the snake and the food.
# Draw the snake
pygame.draw.rect(window, green, (x, y, block_size, block_size))

# Draw the food
pygame.draw.rect(window, red, (food_x, food_y, block_size, block_size))
4. Main Game Loop
The main game loop runs continuously until the game ends. It updates the game window, handles user input, and checks for game over conditions.
while not game_over:
    # Handle user input

    # Update the game window

    # Check for game over conditions
Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully created a Snake Game. Enjoy playing it and feel free to customize and enhance the game further based on your preferences.

Please note that the code provided above is just an outline to give you a general idea of how to implement a Snake Game. You would need to fill in the details and complete the code to make it functional.
